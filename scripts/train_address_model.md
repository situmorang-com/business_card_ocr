Detailed Breakdown:
	1	Data Loading and Splitting:
	◦	Load a labeled dataset with text and labels (1 for address, 0 for non-address).
	◦	Split the data into training and testing sets.
	2	Text Vectorization:
	◦	TF-IDF is used here to transform the text data into numerical features.
	◦	n-gram range of (1, 2) to capture unigrams and bigrams for better context understanding.
	3	Model Training:
	◦	RandomForestClassifier is used as it works well for text classification and handles complex data well.
	◦	A pipeline is used to combine the vectorization and classification into one step for easier management.
	4	Model Evaluation:
	◦	After training, the model is evaluated using the test data to see how well it performs in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
	5	Model Usage:
	◦	Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict whether new blocks of text are addresses or not.
Feature Engineering Ideas for Better Accuracy:
	•	Zip Code Patterns: Include regex matching for common zip code patterns in different countries.
	•	Address Keywords: More comprehensive list of keywords like "Street", "Ave", "Blvd", "Kav".
	•	Presence of Numbers: Addresses generally have numbers; the presence of numeric tokens can be a good feature.
	•	Geographic Entity Detection: Use an NER model to detect geographic entities and add these as features.
Improving Model Performance:
	•	Data Augmentation: Generate synthetic examples of addresses (e.g., using random street names, numbers, cities) to increase the diversity of the dataset.
	•	Balanced Dataset: Ensure the dataset has balanced classes to avoid the model being biased towards non-address text.
By following this approach, we leverage machine learning to classify text blocks as addresses or non-addresses effectively. This approach can also be combined with other techniques, such as rule-based filtering, to increase robustness and accuracy.
